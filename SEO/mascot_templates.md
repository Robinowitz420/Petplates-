---

## Prep Puppy (Recipes & meal prep — serious, practical)

### 1) Tooltip — “Portioning”
**Use when**: Hover tooltip near serving/portion controls.

“Portions aren’t vibes. They’re measurements. Start consistent, then adjust based on your pet’s response and your vet’s guidance.”

### 2) On-page intro — “Meal prep routine”
**Use when**: Top of meal prep or cooking guide pages.

“You don’t need perfect. You need repeatable. Pick a base routine you can cook weekly, then rotate ingredients on purpose—not at random.”

### 3) Inline helper — “Storage”
**Use when**: Under storage/refrigeration notes.

“Treat storage like part of the recipe. If it can spoil, it needs a clock. Cool fast, portion clean, label it, and don’t gamble with leftovers.”

### 4) CTA block — “Generate a plan”
**Use when**: End-of-article CTA for prep-focused pages.

“Ready to stop guessing and start batching? Generate a prep-friendly plan, then cook it the same way every time until it’s dialed in.”

## Professor Purfessor (Nutrition science & health explanations — brilliant, kind)

### 5) Blog intro — “Nutrition-first”
**Use when**: Intro paragraph on nutrition education articles.

“Nutrition can feel like a hundred rules at once. Let’s simplify it into priorities: what matters most, what matters next, and what’s optional noise.”

### 6) Tooltip — “AAFCO-aligned”
**Use when**: Hover tooltip near badges/labels about standards.

“AAFCO is a reference framework for dogs and cats—think guardrails, not magic. It helps prevent common gaps, but it doesn’t replace veterinary care.”

### 7) FAQ answer starter — “Condition page”
**Use when**: First sentence of answers on condition pages.

“Great question—conditions change the *priorities* more than the ingredients. The goal is to reduce risk and keep the plan consistent enough to evaluate.”

### 8) Soft warning — “Exotics”
**Use when**: Birds/reptiles/pocket-pets pages where certainty is lower.

“For exotic pets, the internet is… enthusiast-heavy. We’ll stay conservative: aim for safe staples, introduce changes slowly, and verify uncertain foods with a trusted species source.”

## Sherlock Shells (Food safety, allergies, hard rules — calm, vigilant)

### 9) Banner warning — “Allergy hard blocker”
**Use when**: Any page section discussing allergies.

“Allergies are zero-tolerance. If a food is a known trigger, it does not belong in the plan—no ‘small amounts,’ no ‘maybe.’”

### 10) Ingredient page quick answer — “Safe/unsafe”
**Use when**: Top of ingredient safety pages.

“Quick answer: if you’re unsure, treat it as unsafe until confirmed. Risk isn’t only the ingredient—it’s dose, form, and what else it’s paired with.”

### 11) Emergency guidance block
**Use when**: Under ‘What to do if they ate it’ sections.

“If you suspect toxicity or a severe reaction, contact a veterinarian or emergency clinic immediately. Online lists are not faster than professional care.”

### 12) Cross-contamination reminder
**Use when**: Near “safe alternatives” or kitchen hygiene notes.

“Safety isn’t just the bowl. It’s the cutting board, the oils, the powders, and the shared utensils. If it can transfer, assume it will.”

## Harvest Hamster (Ingredients, sourcing, variety — earnest, detailed, anxious)

### 13) Ingredient swap helper
**Use when**: Under ‘substitutions’ sections.

“Okay—backup plan time. If you can’t find the exact ingredient, pick a swap from the same category and keep everything else the same so your pet’s routine stays steady.”

### 14) Shopping prep checklist (non-affiliate)
**Use when**: On ingredient pages before cooking.

“Before you buy: check freshness, check storage space, and check how fast you’ll use it. The best ingredient is the one you can prep safely every week.”

### 15) Variety rotation note
**Use when**: Under ‘rotation’ or ‘variety’ sections.

“Variety is good—but only if it’s planned. Rotate one item at a time, keep notes, and don’t change five variables in the same week.”

### 16) “How to introduce a new food” micro-script
**Use when**: Any ‘introducing new foods’ section.

“Start small. Watch appetite and stool. If anything goes weird, pause the experiment and return to the last known-safe routine.”

## Robin RedRoute (Shopping, pricing, affiliate — fast, smug)

### 17) Shopping CTA — “Find best price”
**Use when**: End of shopping-focused pages.

“You’ve got the list. Now let’s not overpay. I’ll route you to the best-priced options and the pack sizes that don’t waste money.”

### 18) Pack-size logic callout
**Use when**: Near cart optimization tips.

“Price per unit beats sticker price. Always. Compare per-ounce/per-pound, then pick the size you’ll actually finish before it goes stale.”

### 19) Disclosure snippet (plain-English)
**Use when**: Near affiliate links.

“Some links may earn Pet Plates a small commission at no extra cost to you. It helps keep the lights on—and I still prioritize value and availability.”

### 20) “Out of stock” fallback
**Use when**: When a recommended item isn’t available.

“Out of stock. Happens. I’m swapping in the closest equivalent so your cart still clears today—same category, similar value, fewer headaches.”
