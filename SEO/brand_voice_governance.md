# Pet Plates — Brand Voice Governance (Mascot Ownership Enforcement)

Purpose:
- Keep the site funny and memorable **without** role bleed.
- Ensure YMYL pages remain safe, conservative, and trustworthy.

Non-negotiables:
- **One mascot voice per page/section.**
- Mascots can be “authors,” but **medical authority is not implied**.
- Disclaimers and policy text stay neutral (no character voice).

---

## 1) Mascot canon (roles + personality anchors)

### Prep Puppy — Final Meal Prep
- **Role**: cooking steps, prep routines, storage, “how to do it.”
- **Personality**: tries to be Gordon Ramsay-serious; actually a goof.
- **Language cues**:
  - punchy imperatives (“Right. Listen up.”)
  - earnest pride + accidental goofiness

### Professor Purfessor — Nutrition Specialist & Food Scientist
- **Role**: nutrition concepts, standards guardrails, compatibility explanations.
- **Personality**: nerdy, scatterbrained, brilliant.
- **Language cues**:
  - “According to my calculations…”
  - tangents + quick recovery
  - defines terms calmly

### Sherlock Shells — Ingredient + Meal Discovery
- **Role**: discovers ingredients, curates meals, flags safety boundaries.
- **Personality**: stoic, cold, mopey.
- **Language cues**:
  - short, decisive sentences
  - suspicion of low-quality inputs
  - “case closed” energy

### Harvest Hamster — Farming & Sourcing
- **Role**: ingredient origin stories, seasonality, freshness, swaps.
- **Personality**: ADHD, jovial.
- **Language cues**:

## 2) Hard boundaries (what each mascot must NOT do)

- **Prep Puppy** must not:
  - claim medical outcomes
  - recommend supplements for conditions

- **Professor Purfessor** must not:
  - sound like a veterinarian diagnosing
  - give emergency instructions (Sherlock owns urgency)

- **Sherlock Shells** must not:
  - do affiliate/shopping pitches
  - write playful, upbeat rambles

- **Harvest Hamster** must not:
  - give medical advice
  - write “serious authority” tone

- **Robin RedRoute** must not:
  - pitch products inside medical sections
  - speak about toxins/symptoms with confidence beyond sources

## 4) “Wrong voice” rewrite examples (role bleed prevention)

### Example A — Condition page (should be Professor, NOT Robin)
- **Wrong (Robin-ish)**:
  - “Buy this supplement and your CKD cat will be way better. Trust me.”
- **Right (Professor)**:
  - “For CKD, the priorities change. Use conservative planning rules and coordinate with your veterinarian—especially if your cat is on a prescription diet.”

### Example B — Ingredient toxicity (should be Sherlock, NOT Prep Puppy)
- **Wrong (Prep Puppy-ish)**:
  - “No worries, just cook it longer and it’ll be fine!”
- **Right (Sherlock)**:
  - “Do not gamble on preparation methods to ‘fix’ risk. If ingestion occurred and symptoms appear, contact a veterinarian or emergency clinic.”

### Example C — Prep routine (should be Prep Puppy, NOT Professor)
- **Wrong (Professor-ish)**:
  - “The optimal thermal gradient suggests…”
- **Right (Prep Puppy)**:
  - “Cook it consistently. Cool it fast. Portion it clean. If you can’t repeat it, you can’t improve it.”

### Example D — Sourcing (should be Harvest Hamster, NOT Sherlock)
- **Wrong (Sherlock-ish)**:
  - “Your produce choices are unacceptable.”
- **Right (Harvest)**:
  - “Okay okay—if you can’t find the exact green, swap within the same category and change one thing at a time so your routine stays calm.”

### Example E — Shopping (should be Robin, NOT Professor)
- **Wrong (Professor-ish)**:
  - “Evidence suggests a superior cart structure…”
- **Right (Robin)**:
  - “Ignore sticker price. Compare $/unit, buy the size you’ll actually finish, and stop funding the overpriced option.”

## 5) Editorial checklist (quick)

Before publishing a page:
- Confirm **one mascot owner**.
- Confirm disclaimers are neutral.
- Confirm no affiliate links appear in emergency/symptom sections.
- Confirm claims are conservative and sourceable.
- Confirm internal links point to relevant trust pages.
