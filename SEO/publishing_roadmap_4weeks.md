# Pet Plates — 4-Week Publishing Roadmap (Limited)

Scope constraints:
- Publish only the **10 content pages** + the **5 trust pages** already specified.
- No new page proposals.
- Focus on sequencing that improves E‑E‑A‑T, internal linking, and crawl efficiency.

Assumptions:
- You can publish 3–5 pages/week.
- Trust pages ship early to support YMYL credibility.

---

## Week 1 — Trust foundation + highest-risk safety pages

### Publish (5–6 pages)
- **Trust pages (publish first):**
  - How Pet Plates Recipes Are Created (Prep Puppy)
  - Our Nutrition Standards (Professor Purfessor)
  - How We Use AAFCO Guidelines (Professor Purfessor)
  - What Pet Plates Is (and Is Not) (Sherlock Shells)
  - Pet Food Safety & Allergies (Sherlock Shells)

- **Ingredient safety (high urgency):**
  - Is avocado toxic to birds? (Sherlock Shells)

### Internal linking actions
- Add prominent links from each ingredient/condition page template to:
  - Food Safety & Allergies
  - What Pet Plates Is (and Is Not)

### SERP focus
- Quick-answer snippet blocks + FAQ schema (3–5 FAQs/page).

### Update cadence
- After publishing, schedule a quick review in 7 days to adjust:
  - title/H1 alignment
  - FAQ questions that match PAA impressions

---

## Week 2 — Dogs + cats (YMYL traffic + trust reinforcement)

### Publish (4 pages)
- Can dogs eat garlic? (Sherlock Shells)
- Homemade dog food for pancreatitis (Professor Purfessor)
- Can cats eat tuna every day? (Sherlock Shells)
- Homemade cat food for kidney disease (CKD) (Professor Purfessor)

### Internal linking actions
- Add cross-links:
  - Garlic ↔ Pancreatitis
  - Tuna ↔ CKD
- Add “Next step” CTA blocks:
  - Safety pages → “read safety & allergies” + one relevant education page (if available)
  - Condition pages → “nutrition standards” + “AAFCO use” trust page

### SERP focus
- PAA coverage in FAQ:
  - “how much is dangerous”, “what should I do”, “is daily okay”, “when to call a vet”

---

## Week 3 — Reptiles + birds education (stability + linking)

### Publish (3 pages)
- Can bearded dragons eat spinach? (Sherlock Shells)
- Reptile calcium basics (Professor Purfessor)
- Pellets vs seeds for pet birds (Professor Purfessor)

### Internal linking actions
- Add cross-links:
  - Spinach ↔ Reptile calcium basics
  - Pellets vs seeds → Avocado toxicity (and back)

### SERP focus
- “Common mistakes” sections to win mid-page engagement and PAA.

---

## Week 4 — Pocket pets (safety + shopping)

### Publish (2 pages)
- Can rabbits eat iceberg lettuce? (Sherlock Shells)
- Budget-friendly guinea pig grocery list (Robin RedRoute)

### Internal linking actions
- Shopping page should link to:
  - Pocket pet safety guidance (iceberg lettuce page)
  - Food Safety & Allergies trust page
  - What Pet Plates Is (and Is Not)

### SERP focus
- List snippet optimization on shopping page:
  - “Always buy staples”
  - “Value swaps”
  - “Pack-size tips”

---

## Ongoing weekly maintenance (lightweight)

Every week after publishing:
- Refresh 1–2 FAQs per page based on:
  - impressions/clicks
  - PAA terms
- Update internal links if a page becomes a stronger next-step candidate.
- Keep disclaimers consistent on condition pages.

---

## Success criteria (simple)

- Trust pages indexed early and linked sitewide.
- Ingredient pages win quick-answer snippets (or at least PAA visibility).
- Condition pages attract long-tail queries with conservative, credible framing.
- Internal linking forms a closed loop among the 10 pages + trust pages.
