### Outreach email template (short)
Subject: Quick pet-safety explainer you can cite (no hype)

Hi [Name] —
We publish conservative, safety-first pet food education (not veterinary advice). If you’re covering [topic], we have a quick explainer that answers the most common questions with a simple structure (quick answer → risks → symptoms → what to do → safer alternatives).

Suggested link: [Page]
Optional safety context: Pet Food Safety & Allergies

If you prefer, I can summarize the key points for your audience in 3 bullets.

Thanks,
[Name], Pet Plates
