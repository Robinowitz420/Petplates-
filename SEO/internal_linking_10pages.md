# Pet Plates — Internal Linking Strategy (10 Pages Only)

Scope rules:
- This strategy is limited to the **10 pages** in `SEO/page_specs_10pages.md`.
- Trust pages exist and can be linked sitewide, but the **pillar → cluster structure** below is within the 10.
- Avoid over-optimization: prioritize clarity, user intent, and safety.

---

## 1) The 10-page map (pillar → clusters)

### A) Ingredient Safety Pillar (cross-species pattern)
**Cluster pages (5):**
- Dogs: Can dogs eat garlic?
- Cats: Can cats eat tuna every day?
- Birds: Is avocado toxic to birds?
- Reptiles: Can bearded dragons eat spinach?
- Pocket pets: Can rabbits eat iceberg lettuce?

**Internal linking intent:**
- Every ingredient-safety page should link to:
  - One *"what to do if they ate it"* style section (on-page)
  - One *species education/comparison* page (if available in the 10)
  - One *condition* page (if relevant, only if it’s genuinely helpful)

### B) Health Condition Pillar (dogs/cats)
**Cluster pages (2):**
- Dogs: Homemade dog food for pancreatitis
- Cats: Homemade cat food for kidney disease (CKD)

**Internal linking intent:**
- Condition pages should link to *relevant* ingredient-safety pages **only when the ingredient commonly appears in diet questions**.
- Condition pages should also link to the relevant *species basics* page type when/if those pillars exist in the broader site.

### C) Education/Comparison Pillars (birds/reptiles)
**Bird page:**
- Pellets vs seeds for pet birds

**Reptile page:**
- Reptile calcium basics

**Internal linking intent:**
- These should act as “explainers” that reduce anxiety and stabilize decision-making.
- They should link into the highest-risk safety page for that species (bird → avocado; reptile calcium → spinach page).

### D) Shopping/Cost Pillar (pocket pets)
**Shopping page:**
- Budget-friendly guinea pig grocery list

**Internal linking intent:**
- Shopping pages should link **outward** to safety/feeding guardrails so the user doesn’t buy the wrong thing.
- Avoid linking from medical-condition pages into shopping pages.

## 2) Recommended cross-links (within the 10)

### Dogs
- **Garlic (dogs) → Pancreatitis (dogs)**
  - Anchor ideas: “If your dog has a medical condition (like pancreatitis)…”, “diet changes for sensitive dogs”
  - Rationale: directs risk-aware users to the higher-caution diet mindset page.

- **Pancreatitis (dogs) → Garlic (dogs)**
  - Anchor ideas: “ingredients to be cautious with”, “seasonings and hidden additives”
  - Rationale: prevents accidental inclusion of risky seasonings.

### Cats
- **Tuna (cats) → CKD (cats)**
  - Anchor ideas: “if your cat has kidney disease…”, “condition-friendly planning priorities”
  - Rationale: high overlap in intent (cat owners asking daily diet questions often have underlying health concerns).

- **CKD (cats) → Tuna (cats)**
  - Anchor ideas: “common ‘daily food’ questions”, “fish frequency questions”
  - Rationale: captures PAA paths without adding new pages.

### Birds
- **Pellets vs seeds → Avocado toxicity**
  - Anchor ideas: “foods to avoid”, “high-risk foods (read this first)”
  - Rationale: safety-first pathway.

- **Avocado toxicity → Pellets vs seeds**
  - Anchor ideas: “safe staple diet choices”, “building a safer routine”
  - Rationale: gives a constructive next step after a warning.

### Reptiles
- **Calcium basics → Spinach (bearded dragons)**
  - Anchor ideas: “greens that complicate balance”, “spinach and common feeding mistakes”
  - Rationale: connects abstract concepts to a real choice.

- **Spinach (bearded dragons) → Calcium basics**
  - Anchor ideas: “Ca:P explained”, “why some greens are ‘limit’ foods”
  - Rationale: educates without expanding scope.

### Pocket pets
- **Iceberg lettuce (rabbits) → Budget guinea pig grocery list**
  - Anchor ideas: “budget-friendly produce staples”, “value swaps for greens”
  - Rationale: only link if context is “shopping for greens”; keep it optional.

- **Budget guinea pig grocery list → Iceberg lettuce (rabbits)**
  - Anchor ideas: “greens to avoid or limit”, “ingredient safety check”
  - Rationale: shopping page should promote safety checks.

## 3) Breadcrumb rules

Goal: clarity and consistent taxonomy while avoiding keyword stuffing.

- Ingredient safety pages:
  - Home → [Species] → Ingredient Safety → [Ingredient]

- Condition pages:
  - Home → [Species] → Health Conditions → [Condition]

- Education/comparison pages:
  - Home → [Species] → Nutrition Basics → [Topic]

- Shopping pages:
  - Home → Pocket Pets → Shopping Guides → [Topic]

If the site does not currently have these hub pages, use breadcrumbs as **conceptual taxonomy** until hubs exist.

---

## 4) Anchor text rules (avoid over-optimization)

- Use mostly **natural-language anchors**:
  - Good: “foods to avoid”, “what to do next”, “safer routine basics”
  - Avoid: repeating exact-match “can dogs eat garlic” as the anchor everywhere

- Diversify anchors via intent:
  - **Action**: “what to do if…”, “next steps”, “safety checklist”
  - **Education**: “why it matters”, “how to think about…”, “common mistakes”
  - **Navigation**: “back to [species] guides”

- One exact-match anchor per page (optional), maximum.

## 5) Sitewide trust-page linking (recommended)

Even though trust pages are outside the “10-page” constraint, they should be globally available and linked consistently.

- Ingredient safety pages should link to:
  - Pet Food Safety & Allergies
  - What Pet Plates Is (and Is Not)

- Condition pages should link to:
  - Our Nutrition Standards
  - How We Use AAFCO Guidelines
  - What Pet Plates Is (and Is Not)

- Shopping page should link to:
  - What Pet Plates Is (and Is Not)
  - (If/when present) affiliate disclosure page type
