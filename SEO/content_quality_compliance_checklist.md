# Pet Plates — Content Quality & Compliance Checklist (YMYL)

Use this checklist for every published page in the **10-page set** + **trust pages**.

Core principles:
- Safety-first language.
- Educational planning support only; no diagnosis/treatment.
- Avoid overconfidence and absolutes.
- Mascot ownership is strict: one voice per page.

---

## 1) Page intent + scope controls
- **Primary query answered early**: H1 + the first 100–200 words clearly answer the searcher’s question.
- **Scope is contained**: no new page proposals; no expansive condition lists beyond what the page covers.
- **No sensationalism**: avoid “toxic!” clickbait tone; use calm, factual framing.

---

## 2) Mascot ownership QA (role enforcement)

### Mascot role rules
- **Prep Puppy**: final meal prep, cooking steps, portioning mechanics, storage basics.
- **Professor Purfessor**: nutrition education, standards, compatibility reasoning, non-medical “priorities.”
- **Sherlock Shells**: ingredient discovery, meal discovery, safety boundaries, suspicious/stoic tone.
- **Harvest Hamster**: farming/sourcing energy, seasonality, freshness, substitutions (non-affiliate).
- **Robin RedRoute**: delivery/logistics, shopping/checkout voice, stubborn/talkative.

### Checklist
- **Single mascot voice** throughout body copy.
- **No role bleed**:
  - Robin does not give medical/nutrition conclusions.
  - Sherlock does not do checkout/delivery banter.
  - Prep Puppy doesn’t claim scientific authority.
- **“Company voice” sections** (privacy/disclaimers) remain neutral, not in-character.

---

## 3) Medical / veterinary disclaimer placement

### Where disclaimers must appear
- **Condition pages**: within first screen (above the fold).
- **Ingredient toxicity pages**: near “what to do if…” section.

### Approved disclaimer pattern (short)
- “This page is educational and not veterinary advice. If your pet has symptoms or a condition, contact your veterinarian.”

### Red flags (remove/avoid)
- “Vet-approved” unless verified.
- “Guaranteed safe” / “always safe” / “never harmful.”

---

## 4) Evidence and attribution rules (E‑E‑A‑T)

### Citation/attribution pattern
- Prefer referencing:
  - veterinary hospitals/clinics (VCA, university vet sites)
  - animal poison control resources
  - species-appropriate care orgs
  - AAFCO definitions for dogs/cats standards context

### When to cite
- Any time you:
  - claim toxicity status
  - describe symptom clusters
  - define standards/ratios
  - recommend contacting vet/poison control (include official name)

### How to cite (lightweight)
- Add a “Sources” section at the bottom with 2–6 items.
- Don’t cite random blogs for high-stakes claims.

---

## 5) Ingredient safety page QA (Garlic/Tuna/Avocado/Spinach/Iceberg)

### Required sections
- **Quick answer** (1–2 sentences)
- **Why it’s risky** (plain-language)
- **Symptoms to watch for**
- **What to do if they ate it** (clear, conservative)
- **Safer alternatives** (actionable)

### Safety language rules
- Prefer: “can be dangerous”, “often discouraged”, “commonly considered unsafe for many birds”, “risk depends on form and amount.”
- Avoid: precise dose thresholds unless sourced.

---

## 6) Condition page QA (Pancreatitis / CKD)

### Required sections
- **Quick answer** + safe framing (“work with your vet”)
- **Top priorities** (what matters most)
- **Common mistakes** (prevents harm)
- **When to pause and consult your vet** (red flags)
- **How Pet Plates helps** (educational, not medical)

### Forbidden claims
- No promises to reverse disease.
- No “best diet” absolutes.

---

## 7) Shopping / affiliate page QA (Guinea pig grocery list)

### Required blocks
- **Disclosure** (plain English)
- **Value logic** (price per unit, pack size, waste avoidance)
- **Safety guardrails** (link back to safety/trust pages)

### Avoid
- Medical claims tied to purchases.
- “Doctor recommended” product language.

---

## 8) Internal linking QA (within the 10 + trust)
- Every page links to at least **1 trust page**.
- Condition pages link to:
  - Nutrition Standards
  - How We Use AAFCO Guidelines
- Ingredient safety pages link to:
  - Food Safety & Allergies
  - What Pet Plates Is (and Is Not)
- Anchor text is varied (no exact-match repetition sitewide).

---

## 9) On-page UX QA (skim + clarity)
- H2s are concrete and question-shaped when helpful.
- Use short paragraphs and bullet lists.
- Define jargon (Ca:P, taurine, etc.) in one sentence.

---

## 10) Final pre-publish checklist
- Spellcheck + consistent capitalization.
- Dates/“reviewed” stamps are accurate.
- FAQs are truly answered on the page.
- Schema markup (if used) matches visible content.
