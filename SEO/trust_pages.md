## 2) Our Nutrition Standards
- **Suggested mascot**: Professor Purfessor
- **Tone guidelines**: Brilliant but kind. Explain the “why” without overwhelm. Avoid medical claims.

### Short copy (hero + intro)
Pet Plates is nutrition-first. For dogs and cats, we aim for patterns that align with recognized nutritional standards and promote completeness, not trend-based guesswork. For birds, reptiles, and pocket pets, we stay conservative: we prioritize safety, routine consistency, and clarity, and we use soft warnings when online advice is ambiguous.

### Bullet outline
- **Guiding principles**
  - Consistency beats chaos (repeatable routines matter)
  - Ingredient clarity over “mystery mixes”
  - Conservative safety stance for risky or uncertain items
- **Dogs & cats (AAFCO-aligned planning)**
  - “Complete and balanced” as the target posture
  - Macro and key nutrient awareness (plain-language, not lab promises)
- **Exotics (soft-warning approach)**
  - Guidance is educational and conservative
  - Encourage species-appropriate care resources and veterinary input
- **Quality & sourcing posture**
  - Prefer recognizable ingredients and predictable handling
  - Avoid “magic ingredients” claims

## 3) How We Use AAFCO Guidelines
- **Suggested mascot**: Professor Purfessor
- **Tone guidelines**: Academic-but-readable. Define terms. Avoid over-precision.

### Short copy (hero + intro)
AAFCO guidelines are widely used as nutritional reference points for dogs and cats. Pet Plates uses these guidelines as planning guardrails: to help you avoid common gaps, keep recipes grounded, and support a “complete and balanced” mindset. This does not replace veterinary advice, prescription diets, or individualized medical care.

### Bullet outline
- **What AAFCO is (plain-language)**
  - A reference framework used across the pet food world
- **How Pet Plates uses AAFCO (what this means for you)**
  - Guardrails to reduce common deficiencies
  - A consistent standard for dogs/cats planning pages
- **What AAFCO use does NOT mean**
  - Not a medical diagnosis or treatment
  - Not a guarantee that one meal fixes health outcomes
- **When to defer to a vet**
  - CKD, pancreatitis, diabetes, urinary disease, allergies with severe reactions

## 4) What Pet Plates Is (and Is Not)
- **Suggested mascot**: Sherlock Shells
- **Tone guidelines**: Calm, vigilant, firm boundaries. Zero ambiguity.

### Short copy (hero + intro)
Pet Plates is an educational meal-planning and ingredient-safety support platform. We help you build clearer homemade-meal routines and avoid common safety mistakes. Pet Plates is not a veterinarian, not a prescription-diet replacement, and not a substitute for medical diagnosis or treatment.

### Bullet outline
- **Pet Plates is**
  - Educational planning support
  - A structured way to think about ingredients and routines
  - A safety-first helper that flags obvious risks
- **Pet Plates is not**

## 5) Pet Food Safety & Allergies
- **Suggested mascot**: Sherlock Shells
- **Tone guidelines**: Calm, cautious, “hard rules” mindset. Emphasize zero-tolerance for allergies.

### Short copy (hero + intro)
Food safety is not optional. Pet Plates treats allergies and contraindications as hard boundaries: if an ingredient is a known problem for your pet, it does not belong in the plan. We also encourage conservative decision-making for “unknown” foods—when in doubt, verify with a trusted veterinary or species-specific source.

### Bullet outline
- **Allergies = hard blockers**
  - “Known allergy” means zero-tolerance
  - Cross-contact awareness (shared utensils, powders, oils)
- **Contraindications & high-risk ingredients**
  - Conservative “avoid/limit” posture for risky items
- **Safe handling basics (high-level)**
  - Fresh food time limits
  - Storage hygiene and spoilage awareness
- **How to use ingredient-safety pages**
  - Quick answer → risks → symptoms → what to do → safer alternatives
- **Emergency boundary**
  - If you suspect toxicity or severe reaction: contact your vet/ER immediately
