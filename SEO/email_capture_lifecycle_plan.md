# Pet Plates — Email Capture + Lifecycle Content Plan

Scope constraints:
- Support only the existing **10 pages** + **trust pages**.
- No new page proposals.
- Mascot ownership is strict; each email has one primary voice.

Goals:
- Capture emails with high-intent, low-friction lead magnets.
- Build trust (YMYL-safe) and move users to the next best page in the 10-page set.

## 5) CTA standards (conversion + trust)

- Keep CTA copy plain:

- Avoid fear-based CTAs.
- Place affiliate disclosures only on emails that include shopping links.
