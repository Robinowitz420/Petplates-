# Pet Plates — Affiliate Revenue Architecture (Content-Only, Limited)

Scope constraints:
- Monetize **only** the existing **10 pages** + **trust pages**.
- No new page proposals.
- Maintain YMYL safety boundaries: no medical claims tied to purchases.
- Mascot owner for monetization voice: **Robin RedRoute**.

---

## 1) Monetization model (simple and compliant)

### What we monetize
- Kitchen-safe staples that are broadly useful and low-risk:
  - measuring tools, food scales, storage containers, cooling racks
  - species-appropriate basics (only when non-medical and non-controversial)
  - grocery list/pack-size optimizations for the guinea pig shopping page

### What we do NOT monetize
- “Treatment” claims (supplements, remedies) for conditions.
- Products pitched as curing/improving medical outcomes.
- Fear-based upsells.

---

## 2) Placement strategy mapped to the 10 pages

### A) Ingredient safety pages (5)
Pages:
- Garlic (dogs)
- Tuna every day (cats)
- Avocado (birds)
- Spinach (bearded dragons)
- Iceberg lettuce (rabbits)

**Goal**: Keep these pages trust-first.

**Allowed affiliate placements (lightweight)**
- Bottom-of-page “Next step” card:
  - **Non-medical kitchen safety** items (food scale, labeled containers)
  - “Read the safety page” trust link

**Placement rule**
- No affiliate links in “toxicity / emergency / what to do” sections.

**Copy standard (Robin-owned, short)**
- “If you’re cooking at home, don’t guess portions—use a scale. I’ll link a solid one.”


### B) Condition pages (2)
Pages:
- Pancreatitis (dogs)
- CKD (cats)

**Goal**: Preserve credibility (YMYL).

**Allowed affiliate placements (very minimal)**
- Only neutral kitchen tools:
  - food scale
  - storage containers
  - thermometer (food safety)

**Forbidden**
- Condition-specific supplements or claims.
- “Best food for pancreatitis/CKD” shopping pushes.


### C) Education/comparison pages (2)
Pages:
- Pellets vs seeds (birds)
- Reptile calcium basics

**Goal**: Educational authority; avoid product wars.

**Allowed affiliate placements**
- One “Starter kit” block at bottom:
  - measuring tools
  - storage
  - (Optional) neutral references if they are truly generic and not medically framed


### D) Shopping page (1)
Page:
- Budget-friendly guinea pig grocery list

**Goal**: Primary monetization page.

**Allowed affiliate placements (stronger)**
- “Where to buy” section with links by category:
  - hay (if you already sell/track it), pellets (neutral), produce staples (non-medical)
  - pack-size best value options
- “Value swaps” section with 2–3 alternative links per category

**Disclosure**
- Include plain-English affiliate disclosure near first link.

---

## 3) Page block library (reusable components, content-only)

### Block 1: Affiliate disclosure (Robin)
- Short:
  - “Some links may earn Pet Plates a small commission at no extra cost to you. I still prioritize value and availability.”

### Block 2: “Buy once, use forever” kitchen tools (Robin)
- Items:
  - digital food scale
  - glass storage containers
  - labels/marker
- Copy rule:
  - no health outcomes, just practicality and cost per use.

### Block 3: “Pack-size math” callout (Robin)
- Show price-per-unit heuristic:
  - “Ignore sticker price. Compare $/oz or $/lb, then buy the size you’ll actually finish.”

### Block 4: “Safety boundary” box (Sherlock)
- Not affiliate; trust reinforcement:
  - “If your pet has symptoms or a condition, contact a veterinarian.”

---

## 4) Disclosure + compliance standards

### Required disclosure placements
- Shopping page: above first affiliate link.
- Any other page: at first affiliate block.

### Language rules
- Avoid:
  - “vet-approved”, “clinically proven” unless documented
  - “treats”, “heals”, “prevents”
- Prefer:
  - “helpful tool”, “convenient”, “often used”, “easy to portion”

---

## 5) Internal linking for revenue without new pages

### Funnel behavior (within existing set)
- Ingredient safety/education pages → trust pages + (when relevant) the guinea pig grocery list (only for pocket pet contexts)
- Shopping page → trust pages (what we are/aren’t + safety)

---

## 6) Measurement (content-only KPIs)

- **CTR** on affiliate blocks by page type.
- **EPC** (earnings per click) per category.
- **RPM** (revenue per 1k sessions) for the guinea pig shopping page.
- **Trust guardrail**: bounce rate on condition pages should not spike after adding affiliate blocks.
