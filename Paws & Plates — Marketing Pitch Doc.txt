Paws & Plates — Marketing Pitch Doc
One-liner

Paws & Plates helps pet owners meal prep safely at home with free, personalized meal plans and recipes for dogs, cats, birds, reptiles, and pocket pets.

Elevator pitch

Most pet nutrition tools either push supplements, sell expensive delivery subscriptions, or ignore “non-mainstream” pets entirely. Paws & Plates is a free meal-prep platform that creates custom recipes and meal plans based on your pet’s species, breed, age, activity level, and constraints—then gives you a shopping list with optional affiliate purchase links so you can cook confidently and consistently.

The problem

Pet owners who want to cook at home face:

Information overload: contradictory advice, unsafe food lists, unclear portioning

Lack of coverage: birds/reptiles/pocket pets have far fewer trustworthy diet tools

No personalization: generic recipes ignore age, activity, allergies, and health concerns

“Meal prep friction”: planning + shopping + consistent portions is the hardest part

The solution

Paws & Plates turns “What should I feed my pet?” into a guided workflow:

Create a pet profile (species → breed → age → activity → constraints)

Generate meals with a compatibility score + nutrition breakdown

Save meals and assemble a meal plan

Shop ingredients via a curated list (with affiliate links where available)

Who it’s for

Primary: pet owners worldwide who want to meal prep at home
Power users / underserved audiences (your wedge):

Bird owners (cockatiels, budgies, finches, parrots)

Reptile owners (bearded dragons, geckos, turtles/tortoises)

Pocket pet owners (hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits, rats, ferrets, etc.)

Why now

Growing interest in fresh/home-prepared feeding

Search demand exploding for “what can my hamster eat / what should I feed my cockatiel”

Competitors are optimized for dogs/cats and/or delivery—not comprehensive meal prep

What makes Paws & Plates different
1) “Meal prep for ALL your pets”

Dogs and cats have options. Exotics and small animals don’t. Paws & Plates is designed to cover them seriously, not as an afterthought.

2) Built for “at-home prep,” not delivery or supplement upsells

Competitors often monetize via subscription food delivery or product packs. Paws & Plates focuses on planning, preparation, and repeatability.

3) Personalization + safety gating

Meal generation is not just random recipes—it’s filtered and scored based on:

species compatibility and avoid/limit lists

age/activity fit

allergies and constraints

nutrition summary + balance indicators

4) Shopping experience that turns plans into action

Every plan ends with a clear ingredient list and “Buy” / “Buy All” options (affiliate-based), reducing drop-off.

“References published nutrition standards where applicable (and clearly labeled)”

(If you do cite AAFCO/other frameworks, say “formulated with reference to” or “aligned to published nutrient profiles” rather than “approved.”)

Trust & safety notes (important)

Paws & Plates should present itself as:

Educational and planning support

Not a substitute for veterinary care

Especially cautious about medical claims (kidney disease, allergies, etc.)

Recommended footer disclaimer (boilerplate):

Paws & Plates provides educational information and meal planning tools. It is not veterinary advice. Consult your veterinarian for medical conditions or dietary changes.
