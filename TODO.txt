instead of the text "Add Meal" for the recipe cards and recipe details pages id rather use the txt "Save Meal"


the recipe page ui's are not matching bc the meal title box is not spanning the width of the page and its not at the top of the page above both collumns.. make the two pages match starting with that. 


the recipe cards say :

Tuna & Green Bean Medley
Est. cost: $2.08/meal • Est. meals: 7

Balanced for your pet

i don't like the subtext "balanced for your pet" i dont want any text like that below the score. and i want the cost breakdown to pop more like a badge or even a small box looking like the cost comparison in the recipe details page.. but smaller to fit recipe cards. 
oh and we still dont have a "Save Meal" button on the meal cards

and i want an orange border around the meal cards. not too thick though


we have this issue: 

## Error Type
Console Error

on the find meals results page

i want orange outlines around all our buttons just like we have around the buttons in the pet profile card. apply that outline to the "Find new Batch" button and the "Add Meal" buttons etc. 

under the saved meals tab of the pet profile 

we need a buton to add a meal from saved meals tab to the meal plan tab
